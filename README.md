# Django-project-zuri
This  is a Django project created for the zuri task with my LMS user name as the project name.

This project exposed me on how to create a virtual environment, and creating my django-project in the virtual environment.
It also exposed me to how to install Django, navigate django, and create a project with django.

This project is to show that django has been successful installed in your terminal.

Pydroid3 was the IDE used for this task
